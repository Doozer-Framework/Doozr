/**
 * Class to convert date strings between Gregorian and Human calendar formats

 * The Human Calendar format has been proposed by Scott Flansburg and can be
 * explained as follows:
 *  The year is made up of 13 months
 *  Each month has 28 days
 *  Counting of months starts from 0 (zero) so the months will run from 0 to 12
 *  New Years day (00) is a monthless day
 *  Note: Leap Years are not yet accounted for in the Human Calendar system
