to save you some time with translating and prevent copying language files all the time, you can use a redirect to another locale folder to use it's translation files instead.
just place a file "redirect" into the concerning locale subdirectory which contains the name of the folder with the translation files to use.
in this example you wouldn't want to translate everything for the UK again, if you have already done so for the normal "en" folder. so i've put a redirect file into this folder which contains the string "en" to tell the class to use that locale instead.
