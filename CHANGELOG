   "Lib" as folder (container) for 3rd-party software/libraries. So a config-value like IDS_ENABLED is ok but SMARTY
   (e. g.) should be removed.

************************************************************************************************************************
CHANGED
 - added comment to regexp() of DoozR.router.php
 - removed __call() MAGIC from DoozR.class.php - not ready yet - implementation was buggy and unfinished
 - removed the static count of possible arguments in genericInstanciate(...) in DoozRBaseClassSingletonGeneric.class.php

ADDED
 - new possibility to add methods (lamba-functions) to classes at runtime like described at stubbles-Blog
   (http://www.stubbles.org/archives/65-Extending-objects-with-new-methods-at-runtime.html). For PHP Version before 5.3
   you need to define the function at runtime with $foo->bar = create_function() (create_function() is available since
   PHP 4). Since PHP 5.3 you can define the method (lamba-function) at runtime with $foo->bar = function() { ...; }

************************************************************************************************************************
CHANGED
 - DoozR is now PHP 5.3 compatible (some 3rd party libraries should be replaced soon @see TODO)
 - new routing through DoozR.router.php - the whole routing part is now configurable through Config.ini.php and executed
   by DoozR.router.php - the mod_rewrite usage is now minimized to redirect any call which is not an existing file or
   not an existing directory AND not a forbidden directory and not a forbidden file to DoozR.router.php. The part is
   known by Wordpress - the people who know how Wordpress process SEO-friendly URLs also know how DoozR does it's
   routing.

ADDED
 - new constants for E_USER_DEPRECATED and E_DEPRECATED for PHP < 5.3

FIXED
 -

DEPRECATED

CHANGED
 - changed folder naming in Demo-App - renaming of folders to ucfirst
 - changes to DB-Wrapper(s) and made the "standard-wrapper" work.
 - renamed the external-folders from "XYZ-latest" to "Lib" (all used 3rd party libraries can now be found in the
   folder(s) "Lib" which make it easier to find out where the code comes from [own or 3rd-party] and ...)

TODO

JJJJ-MM-TT
************************************************************************************************************************
CHANGED
 -

ADDED

   (rapid) development of additional classes. Those classes give you the possiblity to make use of the developer tools
   which ...
 - automatic detection of SOS-logger client-IP - instead of defining an IP and port (e.g. 127.0.0.1:4444) you can define
   the string automatic combined with a port (e.g. automatic:4444) and the logger use the IP from client-host as
   log-target
 - log-collection can now be retrieved as "raw"-collection (seperated content, date, type, ...) so it can be processed
   better. it also now can be injected into logger by new inject() method which is used by Core to inject the content of
   Collecting_Logger to Logger_Facade and so to all attached Loggers

FIXED
 - handling of Exceptions and Errors - does not work

DEPRECATED
 -

TODO
 - the error type of messages dispatched through DoozR's Error-/Exception-Handler get ERROR instead of the origin type
   WARNING
