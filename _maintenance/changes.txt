New Naming Convention for DoozR


we must check the autoloader for a new better and more performant solution.

We provide some important base-classes which can be used (extended) by a user's
application.

The path to the classes is: 
Framework/Core/Controller/


some of those classes are: 

DoozR_Base
DoozR_Singleton

DoozR_Model
DoozR_View
DoozR_Controller



Those classes would become:

Framework/Core/Controller/DoozR/Base/DoozRBase.class.php
Framework/Core/Controller/DoozR/Singleton/DoozRSingleton.class.php
